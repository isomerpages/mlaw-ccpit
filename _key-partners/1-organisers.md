Maxwell Chambers is the world’s first integrated Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) complex, housing best-in-class hearing facilities as well as top international ADR institutions, with 39 custom-designed hearing rooms, and a full suite of support services.

In addition to conducting 24/7 physical hearings, Maxwell Chambers now offers an option to conduct both hybrid and virtual hearings, while catering to clients across different time zones. Leveraging on its state-of-the-art hearing capabilities and video conferencing platforms, Maxwell Chambers maintains its stronghold in the ADR arena through its neutrality and confidentiality of all legal proceedings regardless of the platforms used.

Centrally located in the heart of Singapore’s business district, it is housed within a refurbished four storey conserved building with a stately neoclassical façade. It was originally designed as the Customs House in the early 1940s.
