### Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA)

The Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA) is one of Asia’s leading arbitration centres. SCMA provides a framework for maritime and international trade arbitration that is responsive to the needs of users. Together with SCMA’s specialized Panel of Arbitrators and proven track record, SCMA offers parties a neutral and cost-effective forum to resolve their disputes expeditiously.

SCMA’s Advantage and Distinctive Features:<br>

• Flexible, Un-Administered Model: SCMA adopts an un-administered arbitration approach. Its “light-touch” management is preferred by the global shipping and trading communities and allows parties the full benefits of time and flexibility to resolve their disputes.<br>

• Panel of Maritime Expertise: SCMA has one of the largest panels of specialized maritime arbitrators in Asia. SCMA’s arbitrators are of diverse nationalities and jurisdictions. Although not mandatory, parties may choose to appoint an arbitrator from SCMA’s panel.<br>

• Cost-Effectiveness: SCMA does not charge administration fees nor is there a mandatory scale of arbitrators’ fees. Parties may agree upon rates with the arbitrator.<br>

• Usability: Singapore is listed as one of the three seats of choice for arbitration in BIMCO’s dispute resolution clause, the NYPE Time Charter Party of 2015 and Singapore Ship Sale Form.<br>

• Rules that Reflect the Needs of the Users: SCMA’s rules are simple and kept current with feedback from the industry. Some of the latest features of our rules include the Arb-Med-Arb Clause and Small Claims Procedure for claims under the sum of USD 150,000.<br>

• Enforceable and Final Awards: Singapore is a signatory to the 1958 New York Convention. Arbitral awards issued in Singapore are therefore enforceable in over 150 UN Member States.<br>

• Inclusive Membership Base: Membership of the SCMA is open to companies and individuals from all sectors of the maritime and international trade communities.
