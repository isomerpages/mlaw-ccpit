### Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA)

The Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA) is one of Asia’s leading arbitration centres. SCMA provides a framework for maritime and international trade arbitration that is responsive to the needs of users. Together with SCMA’s specialized Panel of Arbitrators and proven track record, SCMA offers parties a neutral and cost-effective forum to resolve their disputes expeditiously.

SCMA’s Advantage and Distinctive Features:<br>

• Flexible, Un-Administered Model: SCMA adopts an un-administered arbitration approach. Its “light-touch” management is preferred by the global shipping and trading communities and allows parties the full benefits of time and flexibility to resolve their disputes.<br>

• Panel of Maritime Expertise: SCMA has one of the largest panels of specialized maritime arbitrators in Asia. SCMA’s arbitrators are of diverse nationalities and jurisdictions. Although not mandatory, parties may choose to appoint an arbitrator from SCMA’s panel.<br>

• Cost-Effectiveness: SCMA does not charge administration fees nor is there a mandatory scale of arbitrators’ fees. Parties may agree upon rates with the arbitrator.<br>

• Usability: Singapore is listed as one of the three seats of choice for arbitration in BIMCO’s dispute resolution clause, the NYPE Time Charter Party of 2015 and Singapore Ship Sale Form.<br>

• Rules that Reflect the Needs of the Users: SCMA’s rules are simple and kept current with feedback from the industry. Some of the latest features of our rules include the Arb-Med-Arb Clause and Small Claims Procedure for claims under the sum of USD 150,000.<br>

• Enforceable and Final Awards: Singapore is a signatory to the 1958 New York Convention. Arbitral awards issued in Singapore are therefore enforceable in over 150 UN Member States.<br>

• Inclusive Membership Base: Membership of the SCMA is open to companies and individuals from all sectors of the maritime and international trade communities.

### Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC)

Since commencing operations in 1991 as an independent, not-for-profit organisation, SIAC has established a track record for providing best in class arbitration services to the global business community. SIAC arbitration awards have been enforced in many jurisdictions including Australia, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Thailand, UK, USA and Vietnam, amongst other New York Convention signatories. SIAC is a global arbitral institution providing cost-competitive and efficient case management services to parties from all over the world.

### Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC)

The Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC) was established in 2015 to meet the growing demand for effective transnational dispute resolution services, especially in light of burgeoning business and trade in Asia and beyond. Due to Singapore’s strategic location in the Asia Pacific region, the SICC is well-placed to provide a trusted neutral venue in support of the diverse Belt and Road Initiatives as our world-class judiciary is known for its efficiency, competence and integrity. The SICC bench comprises a diverse panel of eminent international and local judges who are experienced specialist commercial judges in their own right. Our 16 renowned international judges hail from various parts of the world and come from both civil law and common law traditions.

An important feature of the SICC is that it allows foreign lawyers to represent parties in certain circumstances, so long as they are registered with the Court
and subject themselves to a Code of Ethics.

The SICC adopts international best practices for commercial disputes. Its procedures are flexible and may be tailored to suit parties’ preferences in several aspects. These include the ability to apply for confidentiality orders, adopt rules of evidence such as the International Bar Association (IBA) Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration, and document production rules that are similar to those used in international arbitration instead of general discovery.

Yet, the SICC retains advantages of litigation like the availability of appeal and interim measures. Published judgments with clear grounds of decision will also aid in future disputes of a similar nature. And most vital in multi-party/multi-contract scenarios: the ability to join third and related parties. Finally, parties having their disputes adjudicated at the SICC will find that court fees are quite cost-effective.

In essence, the SICC gives parties a truly unique dispute resolution option – which has been described by some as “arbitration in litigation”, combining the best practices of international arbitration with the substantive principles of international commercial law.
