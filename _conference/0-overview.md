## About the Conference2

The Singapore Ministry of Law, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the International Commercial Dispute Prevention and Settlement Organisation (ICDPASO) will be organising the Singapore-China International Commercial Dispute Resolution Conference on 7 April 2022.

This is the second edition of the successful inaugural conference held in Beijing in 2019, which saw more than 300 judges, government officials, legal and dispute resolution practitioners, in-house counsel and C-suite executives from Singapore and China, and close to 400,000 online participants.

The theme of this year's conference is "the development and future of international commercial dispute resolution." It seeks to examine the recent developments in arbitration, mediation, litigation, as well as hybrid dispute resolution mechanisms, and how they are expected to evolve over the next few years. The conference will also explore how Singapore and China can work together to help businesses resolve commercial disputes more effectively, conveniently and fairly with the aim of advancing cross-border commerce, investment and economic cooperation.
