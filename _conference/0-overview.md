## About the Conference

The Singapore Ministry of Law, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the International Commercial Dispute Prevention and Settlement Organisation will be organising the Singapore-China International Commercial Dispute Resolution Conference on 7 April 2022, supported by Maxwell Chambers and the Xiamen Municipal People's Government.

This is the second edition of the conference, which follows the success of the inaugural conference held in Beijing in 2019.

The Conference brings together government officials, members of the judiciary, legal practitioners and industry professionals from Singapore and China to discuss regarding recent developments in international commercial dispute resolution. The conference will also explore how Singapore and China can work together to help businesses resolve commercial disputes more effectively, conveniently and fairly through the use of mediation, arbitration and/or litigation, with the aim of advancing cross-border commerce, investment and economic cooperation.

We look forward to your participation and wish you a meaningful and productive conference.
