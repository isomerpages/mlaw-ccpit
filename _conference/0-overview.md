## Welcome Message

The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Singapore Ministry of Law sincerely welcome all distinguished guests attending the China-Singapore International Commercial Dispute Resolution Conference. 

The Conference seeks to support the development of the Belt & Road Initiative and advance China-Singapore cooperation in international commercial legal services. The Conference will explore new opportunities for commercial legal services under the Belt and Road Initiative and discuss how China and Singapore can work together to help businesses resolve commercial disputes more effectively, conveniently and fairly through the use of mediation, arbitration and/or litigation, to advance cross-border commerce, investment and economic cooperation.

We wish you a meaningful and productive conference.
