## About the Conference

The Singapore Ministry of Law, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the International Commercial Dispute Prevention and Settlement Organisation (ICDPASO) will be organising the Singapore-China International Commercial Dispute Resolution Conference on 7 April 2022, supported by the Xiamen Municipal People's Government and Maxwell Chambers Pte Ltd.

This is the second edition of the successful inaugural conference held in Beijing in 2019, which saw more than 300 judges, government officials, legal and dispute resolution practitioners, in-house counsel and C-suite executives from Singapore and China, and close to 300,000 online participants.

The theme of this year's conference is "the development and future of international commercial dispute resolution." This is in line with the increasing usage of alternative dispute resolution methods to resolve business disputes globally in recent years. At the same time, commercial dispute resolution frameworks in both Singapore and China have also been enhanced significantly over the past few years. The conference will also explore how Singapore and China can work together to help businesses resolve commercial disputes more effectively, conveniently and fairly through the use of mediation, arbitration and/or litigation, with the aim of advancing cross-border commerce, investment and economic cooperation.

We look forward to your participation. <a href="https://form.gov.sg/60a3368267fcaf0011ff4922">To register, please click on this link.</a>
